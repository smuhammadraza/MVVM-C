MVVM is a design pattern that is widely used in the iOS application development. It take the data presentation and buisness logic of showing data to View out of ViewController making it clean, reuseable and small. ViewModel binds data to to UI elements and changes UI as soon as data changes. ViewController's responsibility is to notify ViewModel about the events that occur on the UI so ViewModel can react to those event accordingly.

Combining co-ordinator with it, further reduces ViewController's responsibilty by taking out the navigation logic from it too and making it completely dumb and reusable.
